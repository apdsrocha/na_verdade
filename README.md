Things weÂ´ve done in class

Reprograma is a 6-week course structured to teach women the basic skills that will help them to become a front-end developer. Twenty five women of different ages and backgrounds were picked out of 300 applications and went through an intensive syllabus including business canvas, ux, html, css and javascript. Aside from classroom teaching, the class invited accomplished speakers to share their experience such as Camila Achutti (Google, Master Tech), Juliana Chahoud (Twitter), Virginia Stefanello (Thoughtworks), among many others. 

This is a compilation of my class exercises.
